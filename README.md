# OCEAN COMMOTION
This project is a test-bed for toying with match-3 game mechanics. It is currently partially modelled after "Candy Crush" with implementation of a few boosters and a bomb.

# SUGGESTED EXERCISES
1. Change the board setup so it generates a board with no matches on start.

2. Add scoring for various kinds of matches (3 of a kind, 4 of a kind etc)

3. Prevent illegal moves (that does not lead to a match). Deal with any implications of that new mechanic to make sure that the player never gets stuck.

4. It is currently possible to mess with the data by making a move while the game is dealing with matches. Solve that.
